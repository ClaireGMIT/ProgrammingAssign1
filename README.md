The attached Jupyter Notebook has been completed as part of assignment 1 of the Programming for Data Analysis course (52465). The assignment reviews the numpy package in Python and is explained via a Jupyter notebook (file name "ProgrammingDataAnalyticsAssignment1"). 
Four tasks, as per the assignment, have been completed:
   1. Explain the overall purpose of the package
   2. Explain the use of the following functions:
        (i) Simple Random Data
        (ii) Permutations
   3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distribution" functions
   4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

For each task a simple descrition has been provided followed by code demonstrating the function in action. References used for explaining the various functions are also provided. To run the code in the Jupyter notebook,  click into the pale bluebox and press <ctrl+ent>. This will run the code.
