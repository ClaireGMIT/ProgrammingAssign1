    "## The purpose of the Jupyter Pacakge (Draft)\n",
    "### Jupyter's name is a reference to the three core programming languages supported by Jupyter, which are Julia, Python and R, and also a homage to Galileo's notebooks recording the discovery of the moons of Jupiter\n",
    "### Jupyter is language agnostic and it supports execution environments (aka kernels) in several dozen languages among which are Julia, R, Haskell, Ruby, and of course Python (via the IPython kernel).\n",
    "### interactive computing across dozens of programming languages\". Spun-off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez, Project Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen languages.\n",
    "### operating philosophy is to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages via the development of open-source software.\n",
    "###  a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents. \n",
    "### Jupyter kernels: A Jupyter kernel is a program responsible for handling various types of request (code execution, code completions, inspection), and providing a reply. Kernels talk to the other components of Jupyter using ZeroMQ over the network, and thus can be on the same or remote machines. Unlike many other Notebook-like interfaces, in Jupyter, kernels are not aware that they are attached to a specific document, and can be connected to many clients at once. Usually kernels allow execution of only a single language, but there are a couple of exceptions. By default Jupyter ships with IPython as a default kernel and a reference implementation via the ipykernel wrapper. Kernels for many languages having varying quality and features are available.\n",
